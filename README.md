🧹 Data Cleaning with Python

📌 Project Overview

Cleaning data is a crucial step in any data analysis workflow, as unclean data can lead to inaccurate insights and poor decision-making. In this repository, I explore various data cleaning techniques using Python and pandas, covering best practices to handle messy data before performing analysis.

🎯 Key Learning Objectives

	✔ Read & Analyze Data from multiple sources 📊
	✔ Summarize Data Attributes at the dataframe, column, and row levels 🔍
	✔ Filter & Select Columns based on specific conditions 🎛
	✔ Handle Messy Data (missing values, duplicates, outliers, and invalid dates) 🚀
	✔ Use Method Chaining for efficient data transformation ⚡
	✔ Visualize Data Issues using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh 📈
	✔ Automate Data Cleaning with custom Python functions and classes 🔄


🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
	• Python 🐍
	• pandas for data manipulation 📊
	• NumPy for numerical operations 🔢
	• Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization 🎨
