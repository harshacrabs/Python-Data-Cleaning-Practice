Getting clean data to reveal insights is essential, as directly jumping into data analysis without proper data cleaning may lead to incorrect results. 
In this repository, I practiced on tools and techniques that can be applied to clean and handle data with Python. 

The topics I practiced are handling missing values, validating errors, removing duplicate data, 
monitoring high volumes of data, and handling outliers and invalid dates. 

Overall below are the key things you can find in the repository:

1) Find out how to read and analyze data from a variety of sources
2) Produce summaries of the attributes of data frames, columns, and rows
3) Filter data and select columns of interest that satisfy given criteria
4) Address messy data issues, including working with dates and missing values
5) Improve the productivity in Python pandas by using method chaining
6) Use visualizations (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Bokeh) to gain additional insights and identify potential data issues
7) Build user-defined functions and classes to automate data cleaning
